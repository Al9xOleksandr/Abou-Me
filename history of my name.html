		<h2>History of name Oleksandr</h2>
		<p>Homer is first mentioned in linear letters B as the second name of Paris (8th century BC). Thanks to the king of Macedonia, Alexander the Great (IV century BC), he was also known as one of the names (epithets) of the goddess Hera (the eldest daughter of Kronos (Saturn) and Rhea), who was thought to be a warrior in battle.
This name comes from the Greek language: the word "alex" means "defender" and "andros" means man. So, Alexander is the one who defends. The name has become popular in many countries, so it may sound different in different languages. So if you hear, for example, the name Iskander, know that it is Turkish Alexander. And short forms in this name - a whole bunch: Sasha, Sanya, Shura, Sashko, Oles ...</p>
