		<h2>History of Khust</h2>
		<p>
Khust is a real gem of Transcarpathia, which is becoming more and more beautiful every year. It seems that the years do not destroy the city, but, on the contrary, give more and more charm and uniqueness. As far back as 1090, the Khust Castle was erected, which was highly trusted by the local people.
It was only through the power and inaccessibility of the Khust Fortress that we managed to build such a beautiful and independent city. Khust absorbed the best of the Transylvanian princes, the Austrian nobles, the strong spirit of the Ukrainian intelligentsia. The name of the city is written in golden letters in the history of the formation of independent Ukraine. The avid and indifferent simple Greek Catholic priest Augustine Voloshin was proclaimed President of the Ukrainian Independent State. True for only a few days, but during this time the capital of the newly formed state was the city of Khust.</p>

<h2>Historical places</h2>
<p> 
 Researchers have found there the remains of life of representatives of the Carpathian mounds. However, the year of foundation of the city of Khust is considered to be 1090. The city has emerged as a center of trade of the agricultural district and one of the centers on the salt road from the Solotvyna mines. Another initial function of Hust was also a defensive one, and in this connection the Hust Castle was built as an outpost on the eastern border of the Hungarian state. Throughout its history, Khust was ruled by the Hungarian state, Austria-Hungary and even Czechoslovakia.There are some of historical places in my Town:</p>
